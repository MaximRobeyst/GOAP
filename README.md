# GOAP
## 1. Introduction
My own implementation of the Goal Oriented Action Planning(GOAP) in a zombie survival game. GOAP is an AI system used in games such as F.E.A.R., S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Fallout 3. GOAP can plan actions dynamically based on world conditions. These actions are then executed if any action or world condition is changed during the execution, the AI then will replan and execute a different plan. This also removes the need for a overly complex predefined graphs such as Finite State Machines and Behaviour Trees.
