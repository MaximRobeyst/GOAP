# GOAP
## i. Introduction
My own implementation of the Goal Oriented Action Planning(GOAP) in a zombie survival game. GOAP is an AI system used in games such as F.E.A.R., S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Fallout 3, that can plan dynamically based on conditions in the world. it reduces the need for predefined transitions from certain states that can make a behaviour tree or finite state machine overly complex.
